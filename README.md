Just uses terminal functions to use as little RAM, GRAM and CPU porcessing

- RAM_Watcher_V2
Takes everything V1 has to offer and uses `Curses` A terminal GUI to amplify
the visuals of the application. V2 was more for my enjoyment to mess around on.
That to say it only takes up 10mb more RAM than V1, for better visuals.
