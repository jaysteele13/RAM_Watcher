## Overview
**RAM_Watcher_V2** is a minimalist, yet powerful terminal tool designed to keep an eye on your system's memory consumption in real-time. Whether you're a developer, sysadmin, or just someone who wants to keep their system running smoothly, **RAM_Watcher** provides a simple and efficient way to visualize RAM usage directly from your terminal.
## 🚀 Features
- **Improved Interface**: More user friendly terminal, using threading more effectively to show data more frequently.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Observe memory consumption in real-time with refresh intervals adjustable to your preference.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed to have minimal impact on system resources, ensuring it remains a helpful tool rather than a burden.
- **Alert System**: Get notified when memory usage exceeds user-defined thresholds, using built in windows functions to avoid storage on your Drive.
- **Timer System**: Shows in real time how close the alerter is to going off again.
- **Hide Terminal System**: Disable all UI and just have RAM_Watcher alert you when your saved threshold goes over the limit.
- **Save System**: Saves all values you insert to save time.
